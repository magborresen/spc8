# MIMO Radar Target Tracking Simulation
This is the project repository for an 8th semester project at AAU. Study program is Signal Processing and Computing.
The project theme is Numerical Scientific Computing.

Project focus is around simulation of a track-before-detect (TBD) algorithm called a
Particle Filter (also known as a Bootstrap Filter or Sequential Monte Carlo).
The implementated code simulates a MIMO radar system (without beamforming) and uses
the received signals as input for the Particle Filter.
